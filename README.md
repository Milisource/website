### Profile.js
- Edit `app/profile.js` to update your name, bio, image, aboutMe, and credits.
    - My `profile.js` will give you a baseplate to go off of.
- Example:
     ```js
     export const profile = {
       name: "Your Name",
       bio: "Your bio here.",
       image: "/pfp.png",
       background: "...",
       aboutMe: "A little about you.",
       credits: {
         profilePicture: {
           url: "https://link-to-artist.com",
           artist: "Artist Name"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
- The site imports this file to display your information throughout the app.

## Enviornment Variables
Your `.env` file should look like this:
```
LASTFM_USERNAME=""
LASTFM_API_KEY=""
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=""
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=""
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=""
```

## Notes
- For music integration, set up your Last.FM, Spotify, and YouTube API keys as described above.

## Limitations
- App can sometimes hit YouTube API limits, avoid rapid refreshes, though we tried to combat this as much as possible.
- It's a Next.JS app, so it's bloated by default.
   - I plan to return later and make this in swelvte.
- Currently no support for more pages.
